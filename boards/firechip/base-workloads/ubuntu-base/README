Ubuntu 20.04 support in Firesim

First time setup notes:
- When running "./marshal build ubuntu-base.json" for the first time, the process MAY end in a login prompt for Ubuntu. Login with "root:firesim", and upon login, exit Qemu with CTRL-A+X
- Login with "root:firesim" when launching with Firemarshal/Firesim
